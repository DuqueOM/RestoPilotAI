**Action:**
1. Drag and drop `menu_photos.zip` and `sales_data.csv` into the upload zone.
2. Click **"Start Autonomous Analysis"**.

**Narrator:**
"Meet the Marathon Agent. Unlike traditional chatbots, it doesn't just answer—it works. Watch as it orchestrates a complex 15-stage pipeline, from visual extraction to strategic planning, completely autonomously."

2. Show the **"Visual Gap Analysis"**: Side-by-side comparison of their tacos vs. yours.

## ✨ Part 3: Vibe Engineering (Quality Assurance) (1:40 - 2:15)

**Visual:** The **"Vibe Verification"** panel glowing or animating.

**Narrator:**
"Enter 'Vibe Engineering'. Before showing you any result, a second Gemini agent audits the work. It checks for hallucinations, logical inconsistencies, and data gaps."

**Action:**
1. Expand the **Verification Panel**.
2. Show a specific check: *"Strategy Alignment: Verified. Campaign targets Star products as recommended."*
3. Show the "Auto-Improved" badge.

**Narrator:**
"If it finds an issue, it fixes it automatically. No human intervention required. Precision, completeness, and clarity—guaranteed."
