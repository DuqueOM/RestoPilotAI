Shot from a slightly low angle to convey authority. The chef wears a clean white chef 
coat with sleeves rolled up, standing behind a stainless steel prep station. Warm 
amber side lighting creates dramatic shadows. Background is a softly blurred 
professional kitchen with copper pots and warm pendant lights. The mood is aspirational 
and premium. Color palette: warm whites, deep charcoal, amber gold highlights. 
Cinematic depth of field, f/2.8 bokeh. No text, no logos. 
Style: editorial food magazine cover quality, like Bon Appétit or Chef's Table.
Aspect ratio 4:3, 800x600 pixels.
```

## 2. `hero-dish.webp` — Setup Wizard Side Accent (640×400)

```

plate. The dish features a perfectly seared protein (salmon or duck) with microgreens, 
edible flowers, and a delicate sauce swoosh. Shot from directly above (90° angle). 
Dark moody background — black marble or dark wood table surface. Dramatic side 
lighting from the left creating long shadows. Small scattered herbs and a linen 
napkin edge visible. Color palette: deep blacks, warm amber from the protein, 
vibrant green microgreens, subtle purple from edible flowers. Ultra sharp focus, 
professional food photography. No text, no logos, no hands.
Style: Michelin-star restaurant menu photography.
Aspect ratio 16:10, 640x400 pixels.

## 3. `dashboard-header.webp` — Analysis Overview Header Background (1920×400)

```
Ultra-wide panoramic photograph of a bustling upscale restaurant interior during 
golden hour service. Shot from a wide angle showing the full dining room. Warm 
ambient lighting from pendant lamps and candles. Softly blurred guests at tables 
in the background. The foreground shows a polished dark wood bar surface with 
two elegant cocktails. Rich warm tones: amber, deep burgundy, soft gold. 
The image should be slightly dark/moody to work as a background behind white text. 
Apply a subtle dark gradient overlay feel — the image should be naturally darker 
on the left side and slightly lighter on the right. Cinematic wide-angle lens, 
shallow depth of field. No faces in sharp focus (privacy). No text, no logos.
Style: luxury hotel restaurant ambiance, architectural digest quality.

Artistic close-up photograph of a chef's hands carefully plating a dish with 
precision tweezers. The hands are placing a delicate microgreen on top of a 
beautifully composed plate. Shot at 45° angle with extremely shallow depth of 
field (f/1.8). Warm amber spotlight from above illuminates just the hands and 
plate. Background is completely dark and out of focus. The plate shows a 
colorful, well-composed dish suggesting strategic precision and attention to 
detail. Color palette: warm skin tones, bright greens, deep blacks, gold 
highlights. No face visible — only hands and plate.

## 5. `campaign-studio.webp` — Campaigns Page Accent (480×320)

```
Creative flat-lay photograph of a food photography setup from above. A beautiful 
plated dish sits in the center on a dark surface, surrounded by photography props: 
a smartphone showing an Instagram-like interface (screen blurred), scattered fresh 
herbs, a small notebook with a pen, a coffee cup, and soft fabric napkins. Warm 
directional lighting from top-left. The composition suggests a content creator's 
workspace for food marketing. Color palette: dark charcoal surface, warm food 
colors, white props as accents, subtle teal from the phone screen. 
Professional overhead shot, sharp focus on the dish, slightly soft edges.
No readable text on any surface. No logos.

```
Warm atmospheric photograph of a happy dining scene in a cozy restaurant. 
Shot from behind the bar or service area looking out at the dining room. 
Soft warm bokeh lights in the background. In the mid-ground, blurred silhouettes 
of diners at a candlelit table, one person gesturing expressively (suggesting 
conversation and enjoyment). Foreground shows the edge of a polished bar surface 
with a wine glass. The mood is warm, inviting, and emotionally positive. 
Color palette: warm amber, soft gold bokeh, deep burgundy, candlelight yellows. 
Everything slightly soft and dreamy — no sharp faces (privacy). No text, no logos.

Aspect ratio 3:2, 480x320 pixels.
```

## 7. `competitors-market.webp` — Competitors Page Accent (480×320)

```
Dramatic aerial/bird's-eye photograph of a vibrant restaurant street or food 
market at dusk. Multiple restaurant facades with warm glowing lights, outdoor 
seating with string lights, and a bustling atmosphere. Shot from a slightly 
elevated angle (30° from above). The scene suggests a competitive restaurant 
district. Warm evening lighting mixed with cool blue dusk sky. Small blurred 
figures of pedestrians add life without identifiable faces. Color palette: 
warm restaurant glows (amber, gold), cool blue twilight sky, green from 
potted plants, warm string light bokeh. No specific restaurant names visible.
Style: urban food scene photography, travel magazine quality.
Aspect ratio 3:2, 480x320 pixels.
```

## 8. `empty-state-plate.webp` — Empty State Placeholder (400×300)

```
Minimalist photograph of a single empty white ceramic plate on a dark matte 
surface, shot from directly above. The plate is perfectly centered with generous 
negative space around it. A single small herb sprig (rosemary or thyme) rests 
on the plate as a subtle accent. Very soft, diffused lighting from above — 
almost shadowless. The mood is clean, minimal, and expectant — suggesting 
"something beautiful is about to be created here." Color palette: pure white 
plate, dark charcoal/black surface, single green herb accent. 
Ultra clean, minimalist composition. No text, no logos.
Style: minimalist product photography, Kinfolk magazine aesthetic.
Aspect ratio 4:3, 400x300 pixels.
```

## 9. `pattern-food.webp` — Tileable Background Pattern (600×600)

```
Seamless tileable pattern of scattered food ingredients on a dark charcoal 
surface, shot from directly above. Ingredients are small and evenly distributed: 
peppercorns, small herb leaves (basil, thyme), tiny cherry tomatoes, garlic 
cloves, small chili peppers, and scattered sea salt crystals. Each ingredient 
is small (thumbnail size) with generous spacing between them. Very subtle, 
low-contrast — the ingredients should be visible but not overwhelming (about 
30% opacity feel). Soft overhead lighting, minimal shadows. The pattern must 
tile seamlessly — ingredients should not be cut off at edges in a way that 
breaks the repeat. Color palette: dark charcoal background, muted warm tones 
for ingredients. No text, no logos.
Style: subtle food texture pattern, suitable as a repeating background.
Square format 600x600 pixels.

## Technical Notes for Image Placement

### File Format
- **Preferred:** `.webp` for optimal web performance (70-80% quality)
- **Fallback:** `.png` if webp not available
- **Place all files in:** `frontend/public/images/`

### Dimensions Guide
- Hero images: Generate at 2x resolution for retina displays, CSS will scale down
- Section accents: 480×320 is the display size, generate at 960×640 for retina
- Background pattern: Generate at 600×600, CSS handles tiling
- Dashboard header: Generate at 1920×400 minimum

### Color Consistency
All images share a unified palette:
- **Primary dark:** `#1a1a2e` (deep navy charcoal)
- **Warm accent:** `#d4a574` (amber gold)
- **Secondary:** `#16213e` (dark blue)
- **Highlight:** `#e8c547` (warm gold)
- **Neutral:** `#2d2d3f` (soft charcoal)

This ensures they blend seamlessly with the app's gradient backgrounds (blue-600 → purple-600).
